# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router v6 and provides a solution.

## Problem

The original `App.js` file showcases a scenario where nested routes fail to render, even though the parent route renders correctly.  This often stems from incorrect route path definitions or a misunderstanding of how nested routes function in React Router v6.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.  The changes resolve the rendering issue and ensure that the nested routes behave as expected.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
